# Resume Builder

A basic CRUD app that lets a user generate and download a resume as a PDF based on the projects they want to highlight.

After signing up, a user can setup some basic information in their profile, add previous experience, and add projects. 
Then, the user can select which projects to highlight on the resume with a few clicks and download their resume in the builder tab.
